# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Overview

Credit risk is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. To determine credit risk, it requires the creditors to evaluate customers based on their credit score. As a result from this, there are classification imbalances with credit risk because good loans outnumber riskier loans. We are tasked to build a classification model using machine learning statistical algorithms to make predictions on the credit risk of a client. In our analysis, we will be using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. We will utilize different machine learning techniques such as `RandomOverSampler`, `SMOTE`, `ClusterCentroids`, `SMOTEENN`, `BalancedRandomForestClassifier`, and `EasyEnsembleClassifier` to train and evaluate data to build a recommendation for the best machine learning model to use for credit risk predictions.
